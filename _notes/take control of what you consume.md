title: Take control of what you consume
---
ðŸŒ±

There is so much to consume and we consume so much of it. It's hard to keep track of it all.

And it means that while there *should* always be something to write about, this tends to not be the case; you sit down and get writer's block.

Building a second brain can help sort through the noise, help you take control of what you consume and form connections that then build into ideas and content.

But, a mostly frictionless system is needed to work through this (and then to publish - [[reduce friction in publishing]]); don't add more complications!
