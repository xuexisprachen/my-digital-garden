title: On language change

üå±

Languages change. They reflect the attitudes and opinions of their speakers. They're a tool to be wielded and although there are some understandable negative attitudes to languages such as English encroaching on smaller languages, when the change is coming from *within* the language and its speaker community, then that change is likely to come to pass.

> Language is a tool used for millions of purposes. Its change is natural: it stretches and it wears away, it widens and it shrinks. It loses its regular shape. And it loses its shape where it is touched by the most people: at everyday words.
