title: Polyglot - How I Learn Languages - Kató Lomb
---
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I don't want to say this is the original guide to input = language learning, but I think it's probably pretty damn close.

Kató Lomb (1909-2003) was a Hungarian interpreter, translator, and all-round language lover who spoke around 16 languages over the course of her lifetime. She was one of the first simultaneous interpreters.

Her book emphasises reading as a starting point to language learning, but also has tips on how to get started speaking, her own methodology for language learning, as well as ten suggestions for successful language learning (as well as her [[equation for success in language learning]]).

If you've been reading up about language learning, then none of this is particularly new - but it's the kind of advice that endures because it's good and useful. It'll stand the test of time; even if some of the technologies change, the underlying methodology remains strong.

### Kató Lomb's method of language learning
- get a (good) dictionary - study words; this is not about memorisation, but becoming used to the language
- buy a textbook and some literature - a textbook with answers provided
- start reading plays or short stories from the outset - write out the words you understand from context on the first read and only look up words you don't know after a second/third read
- listen to the language - emphasis on radio in the book, but now there are many different mediums, so be careful to [[take control of what you consume]]; make sure to listen actively, writing down unknown words, revisit the ideas you've learnt, shadow for pronunciation
- get a tutor - to correct written and verbal mistakes
