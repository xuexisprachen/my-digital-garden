Even if you're an English speaker (and realistically, I think only monolingual English speakers ever find themselves asking this question), only 1.5 billion people worldwide speak the language. There are almost 8 billion people in the world. So, approximately 80% of people *do not speak English.*

## Cognitive Benefits
- link between bilingualism and cognitive flexibility
- people who speak other languages often exhibit more empathy and a global mindset
- strong evidence of a positive effect of learning a language on creativity in language use - in a speaker's **first language**
- most studies report that learning a language has a positive impact on academic achievement across a range of other subjects
- dual language learners may lag behind monolinguals at first, but catch up and show the most benefit across subjects after several years' immersion
- there may be a link between bilingualism and the prevention of dementia, but more research needs to be carried out
